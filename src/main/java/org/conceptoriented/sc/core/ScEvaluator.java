	// Table loop methods will be called once for each record loop
	// It could be useful for initializing internal (static) variables
	// Also, the function could prepare some objects, for example, resolve names or get direct references/pointers to objects which normally may change between evaluation cycles. 
	//
	public void beginEvaluate();

	//
	// Value/record methods will be called once for each evaluation 
	//
	public void evaluate(long row);
	// It will be called from each (dirty) input of the table
	// Here we need to access:
	// 'this' value (long)
	// column data object reference for all columns we need and declared: object ref
	//   these object references have data access API: column.getValue(input) where input can be 'this' or output of other getValue
	//   this includes this column data object so that we can access our own column values: thisColumn.getValue(offset)
	// output/type table is needed if we want to push records into output
	// input table might be needed just to know more about this column
	
	// So the main object we want to use is a column reference which provides access to data
	// How we use it? And how we reference these column objects from the evaluation method? Indeed, there are many columns we want to use. 
	// One way is to use table-column names: Schema.getColumn("My Table", "My Column").getValue(rowid)

	// Yet, we do not want to resolve names for each access. So we want to store direct references
	// Column col1 = Schema.getColumn("My Table", "My Column");
	// Object val1 = col1.getValue(rowid);
	
	// We want to use many columns. There references can be stored in two ways:
	// - In a dictionary or list, which means that we introduce a new referencing system: names or index.
	//   Columns are then accessed, for example, in this way: dict["Amount"].getValue() or list[25].getValue()
	// - In local variables, which means that we have own custom variables and must assign them. 
	//   For example, this class could have variables: col1, col2, amountColumn etc.
	// The best way is that the class decides itself but it has a mechanism for assigning these references. 
	// For example, these column references could be assigned in beginEvaluate or in the constructor. 


	
	
	// We can do row id arithmetics by having access to valid range (but we cannot change these ranges - they will be changed by the driver)
	// It can be needed for rolling functions
	//Range range1 = thisColumn.added; // Dirty, new, to be legally added after they are computed
	//Range range2 = thisColumn.rows; // Clean, have been computed previously
	//Range range3 = thisColumn.removed; // Marked for removal, will be legally removed after this update cycle
	
	// There are two ways how column references can be passed to this class: 
	// - either by the class itself, for example, we always have access to Schema and hence can always resolve column names. 
	// - or are provided from outside when the system gets dependency information and we need to store these references wherever we want
	//   - the dependencies can be requested and column references injected from outside. The system anyway must get dependencies (which columns will be used) in order to build execution plan.  
	//   - the dependencies and column resolution can be requested from inside at any time.
	
	
	// We have to return the type that is expected in the declaration of the column:
	// - primitive data type
	// - table data type
	//   - rowid if we have found some record in the output table. currently, we do not have any means for that.
	//   - record object which will be pushed into the output table and the found rowid will be stored as this column value.
	//     - what the system/table will do with the pushed record is defined by the table (push method)
	//     - for export tables, the record will be pushed but null will be returned which we do not need. 
	//       it is a use case for columns which do not want to store their output values because they are not used
	//       these could be specially implemented export columns with mapping config as a function
	//       or the system could determine such columns automatically, for example, if their output is an export (leaf) table
	
	// We could also find a record in the output/type table instead of pushing it.
