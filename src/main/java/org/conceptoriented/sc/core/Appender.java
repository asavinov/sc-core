/**
 * Objects of this class know where records come from. 
 * It can be viewed as a provider of records which are about to be appended to a table.
 * The records are requested from the appender just before physically adding them to a table.
 * It is used by the table population procedure which is responsible for and knows how adding and removing records.
 * In some cases tables are populated from other internal tables, for example, using product or filter.
 * In other cases tables are populated using external sources and this class is a way to provide such external sources of records.
 * 
 * Table population is normally performed automatically by producing all combinations of records (ids) from the key domains.
 * In other words, we take this table and retrieve all its key columns. Then we take all their domains and produce all combinations.
 * The combinations are appended to this table as new records.
 * 
 * A specific case of this approach is filtering. 
 * In this case, a table has a single key column (super) and hence it effectively copies records from another table.
 * However, the added records can be additionally filtered.
 * 
 * It is also possible to define an external data source as a record provider for this table.
 * If the table population procedure finds an external provider then it will call it to get records. 
 * The records returned by this provider have to be compatible with this table column structure.
