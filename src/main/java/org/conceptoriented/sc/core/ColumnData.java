/**
 * It is responsible for explicit representation of a function, that is, a mapping from input ids to output values.
 * This representation can be changed by setting outputs for certain inputs. And it is possible to request outputs.
 * 
 * Another purpose of this class is to represent the dirty state of the function, that is, whether it is up-to-date.
 * The first part of the status is whether some outputs have been changed (each time an output is change, the flag is raised).
 * The second part of the status whether some inputs have been added or removed without being appropriately processed (for each add or remove of the input, this status is changed).
 * For added and removed inputs, their range can be stored, that is, it is possible to retrieve the range of new (added) input id and the range of removed (deleted) input ids.
 * 
 * There are also functions for reseting the corresponding dirty statuses. 
 * Normally dirty status is reset after the corresponding recorded changes have been processed, that is, propagated through the schema to other functions which depend on them.
