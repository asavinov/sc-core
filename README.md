# Stream Commandr: Integrate. Transform. Analyze. 

Stream Commandr Engine is a Java library for in-stream analytics by integrating incoming data, transforming and analyzing it. 
Its specific feature is that it is based on a column-oriented data representation and column-oriented operations with data. 
Stream Commandr relates to conventional stream processing system like column-oriented databases relate to conventional databases. 
The column-oriented approach to in-stream analytics is especially efficient where very high performance is needed, e.g., in IoT application. 
Operations with data are performed by defining new columns in terms of already existing columns. 
Stream Commandr relies on the concept-oriented model as its theoretical foundation.
